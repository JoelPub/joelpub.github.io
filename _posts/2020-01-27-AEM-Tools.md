## Dispatcher Overview
Dispatcher is Adobe Experience Manager's caching and/or load balancing tool  
[https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/dispatcher.html#the-benefits-of-load-balancing](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/dispatcher.html#the-benefits-of-load-balancing) 
内容交付网络是一种高度分布式服务器平台，为交付 Web 应用程序、流媒体等内容专门优化。服务器网络分布于众多物理和网络位置，对最终用户的 Web 内容请求和快速安全媒体交付作出快速响应。网络在内容服务器（源站）和最终用户（客户端）间起到桥梁作用。

## 为什么要升级AEM
beginning in AEM 6.4 and to be continued in future releases, content is being restructured out of /etc to other folders in the repository, along with guidelines on what content goes where, adhering to the following high-level rules:
AEM product code will always be placed in /libs, which must not be overwritten by custom code
Custom code should be placed in /apps, /content, and /conf

The following are major changes of note over the last several releases of AEM:
AEM 6.0 introduced the new Jackrabbit Oak repository. Persistence Managers were replaced by Micro Kernels . 
Starting from version 6.1, CRX2 is no longer supported. A migration tool called crx2oak needs to be run to migrate CRX2 repositories from 5.6.1 instances. For more information, see Using the CRX2OAK Migration Tool .
If Asset Insights is to be used and you are upgrading from a version older than AEM 6.2, assets must be migrated and have IDs generated through a JMX bean. In our internal tests, 125K assets on a TarMK environment were migrated in an hour, but your results may vary.
AEM 6.3 introduced a new format for the SegmentNodeStore , which is the basis of the TarMK implementation. If you are upgrading from a version older than AEM 6.3, this will require a repository migration as part of the upgrade, involving system downtime.
Adobe Engineering estimates this to be around 20 minutes. Note that reindexing will not be necessary. Additionally, a new version of the crx2oak tool has been released to work with the new repository format.
This migration is not required if upgrading from AEM 6.3 to AEM 6.4.
The pre-upgrade maintenance tasks have been optimized to support automation.
The crx2oak tool command line usage options have been changed to be automation friendly and support more upgrade paths.
The post-upgrade checks have also been made automation friendly.
Periodic garbage collection of revisions and data store garbage collection are now routine maintenance tasks that need to be performed periodically. With the introduction of AEM 6.3, Adobe supports and recommends Online Revision Cleanup. See Revision Cleanup for information on how to configure these tasks.
AEM 6.4 introduces the Pattern Detector for assessment of complexity of the upgrade as you start planning for the upgrade. 6.4 also has a strong focus on backward compatibility of features. Finally, best practices for sustainable upgrades are also added.
For more details about what else has changed in recent AEM versions, see the complete release notes:

JCR-SQL2 queries are useful items in every AEM Developer's toolbag.  They are relatively quick, [aren't deprecated](http://www.day.com/specs/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-2.0/javax/jcr/query/Query.html) and have a familiar SQL like grammer. JCR-SQL2 queries can be invoked from the JCR API:
https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-64/deploying/configuring/monitoring-and-maintaining.html#version-purging
```
Session session = ...
QueryManager queryManager = session.getWorkspace.getQueryManager();
Query query = queryManager.createQuery("{QUERY}", Query.JCR_SQL2);
QueryResult result = query.execute();
```

or through the Sling API:

```
ResourceResolver resolver = ...
Iterator<Resource> result = resolver.findResources("{QUERY}", Query.JCR_SQL2);
```

Although there is an official specification for JCR-SQL2, there aren't a ton of really good resources out there nor good references for finding examples of JCR-SQL2 queries.  Below are some queries I've found useful and I think every developer should have as a reference.  Each item lists a concept, provides an sample query and explains the sample.

## Exploring Sling（SLing原理和应用学习）
Apache Sling, the web application framework that CQ is built on. Both CQ’s native functionality and the functionality of any website built with CQ are delivered through this framework.

## CQ Developer Tricks（前端调试技巧）

**Remove #cf/**   
Don’t want to see/wait for the con­tent-find­er while ref­eresh­ing pages, just remove #cf/ in your url.

**?debug=layout**   

Shows you all details of the com­po­nents used on your page

**?debugConsole=true**   

Runs Fire­bug Lite inside your brows­er

**?wcmmode=(edit|preview|design|disabled)**   
This para­me­ter sets your Wcm­Mode in the spec­i­fied mode, makes test­ing for a par­tic­u­lar Wcm­Mode eas­i­er .

**?debugClientLibs=true**   
https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/the-basics/clientlibs.html#See%20Embedded%20Files
Writes out all Clientlib cat­e­gories as sep­a­rate files (check your HTML-source).
Use the following procedure to see the names of embedded files:

In the address box of your web browser, append the following text to the URL of your HTML:
?debugClientLibs=true

When the page loads, view the page source.
Click the link that is provided as the href for the link element to open the file and view the source code.

**CTRL+SHIFT+U**   

In com­bi­na­tion with ?debugClientLibs=true will show you tim­ing infor­ma­tion of your page

**http://server/libs/cq/ui/content/dumplibs.html**   
https://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-1/develop/the-basics/clientlibs.html#Discover%20Client%20Libraries
Shows you all infor­ma­tion around the clientlibs used in your CQ5-envi­ron­ment.
