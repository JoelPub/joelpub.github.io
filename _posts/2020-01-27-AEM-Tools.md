## 为什么要升级AEM
beginning in AEM 6.4 and to be continued in future releases, content is being restructured out of /etc to other folders in the repository, along with guidelines on what content goes where, adhering to the following high-level rules:
AEM product code will always be placed in /libs, which must not be overwritten by custom code
Custom code should be placed in /apps, /content, and /conf

The following are major changes of note over the last several releases of AEM:
AEM 6.0 introduced the new Jackrabbit Oak repository. Persistence Managers were replaced by Micro Kernels . 
Starting from version 6.1, CRX2 is no longer supported. A migration tool called crx2oak needs to be run to migrate CRX2 repositories from 5.6.1 instances. For more information, see Using the CRX2OAK Migration Tool .
If Asset Insights is to be used and you are upgrading from a version older than AEM 6.2, assets must be migrated and have IDs generated through a JMX bean. In our internal tests, 125K assets on a TarMK environment were migrated in an hour, but your results may vary.
AEM 6.3 introduced a new format for the SegmentNodeStore , which is the basis of the TarMK implementation. If you are upgrading from a version older than AEM 6.3, this will require a repository migration as part of the upgrade, involving system downtime.
Adobe Engineering estimates this to be around 20 minutes. Note that reindexing will not be necessary. Additionally, a new version of the crx2oak tool has been released to work with the new repository format.
This migration is not required if upgrading from AEM 6.3 to AEM 6.4.
The pre-upgrade maintenance tasks have been optimized to support automation.
The crx2oak tool command line usage options have been changed to be automation friendly and support more upgrade paths.
The post-upgrade checks have also been made automation friendly.
Periodic garbage collection of revisions and data store garbage collection are now routine maintenance tasks that need to be performed periodically. With the introduction of AEM 6.3, Adobe supports and recommends Online Revision Cleanup. See Revision Cleanup for information on how to configure these tasks.
AEM 6.4 introduces the Pattern Detector for assessment of complexity of the upgrade as you start planning for the upgrade. 6.4 also has a strong focus on backward compatibility of features. Finally, best practices for sustainable upgrades are also added.

JCR-SQL2 queries are useful items in every AEM Developer's toolbag.  They are relatively quick, [aren't deprecated](http://www.day.com/specs/jsr170/javadocs/jcr-2.0/javax/jcr/query/Query.html) and have a familiar SQL like grammer. JCR-SQL2 queries can be invoked from the JCR API:
https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-64/deploying/configuring/monitoring-and-maintaining.html#version-purging
```
Session session = ...
QueryManager queryManager = session.getWorkspace.getQueryManager();
Query query = queryManager.createQuery("{QUERY}", Query.JCR_SQL2);
QueryResult result = query.execute();
```

or through the Sling API:

```
ResourceResolver resolver = ...
Iterator<Resource> result = resolver.findResources("{QUERY}", Query.JCR_SQL2);
```

Although there is an official specification for JCR-SQL2, there aren't a ton of really good resources out there nor good references for finding examples of JCR-SQL2 queries.  Below are some queries I've found useful and I think every developer should have as a reference.  Each item lists a concept, provides an sample query and explains the sample.

#### **1. Find nodes by type**

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:file] AS s
```

This query will find all of the nt:file nodes in the repository.  Users often start by querying against _nt:base_ which is the base type for all JCR nodes, however if you can limit down to a more specific node type, this can have dramatic performance differences.  Just remember that the node containing the properties you're querying against needs to either be the specified type or a decendent of the type.

#### **2. Find nodes with properties containing a value**

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:base] AS s WHERE CONTAINS(s.title, 'client')
```

This query will find any node with a title property which contains the text client. This can also be accomplished using the LIKE constraint, but is significantly faster as it invokes the Lucene indexes instead of scanning property values.  In a very basic test, I found using CONTAINS to be approximately 100x faster.

#### **3. Finding pages under a path:**

```
SELECT * FROM [cq:Page] AS s WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(s,'/content')
```

This query will select all nodes of the type _cq:Page_ under the path _/content._You could change the node type in the square brackets to query in other node types such as _dam:_ _Asset_ or _rep:user_.

#### **4. Finding nodes by name:**

```
SELECT * FROM [cq:Page] WHERE NAME() = 'content'
```

This query will retrieve any _cq:Page_node with the name "content"; if you used the LOCALNAME function instead of NAME it would ignore the node type prefix, matching names such as jcr:content.

#### **5. Finding non-empty properties**

```
SELECT * FROM [cq:PageContent] WHERE [jcr:title] IS NOT NULL
```

This query will retrieve cq:PageContent nodes where the _jcr:title_ attribute is set. 

**Note:**Pages are not required to have a child of type _cq:PageContent_ so if your templates don't set the child node type this may not always return all of the eligible nodes.

#### **6. Finding pages based on jcr:content properties**

```
SELECT parent.* FROM [cq:Page] AS parent INNER JOIN [nt:base] AS child ON ISCHILDNODE(child,parent) WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(parent, '/content') AND child.[cq:template] = '/libs/cq/personalization/templates/campaign'

```

This query returns _cq:Page_ nodes with a child node where the _cq:template_ is set to _/libs/cq/personalization/templates/campaign._The really nice thing is that it returns the actual page node instead of the child node which contains the value.

#### **7. Finding files with extension**

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:file] WHERE NAME() LIKE '%.png'
```

This query will find files with the .png extension. This can be very useful when looking for bundles, assets or other files which have been uploaded.  To search the DAM, change the node type to _dam:Asset_.

#### **8. Cast Property Values**

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:base] WHERE hideInNav = CAST('true' AS BOOLEAN)
```

Casting allows you to query accurately based on non-String properties.  You can cast into any of the following types:

* STRING
* BINARY
* DATE
* LONG
* DOUBLE
* DECIMAL
* BOOLEAN
* NAME
* PATH
* REFERENCE
* WEAKREFERENCE
* URI

#### **9. Querying on dates**

```
SELECT p.* FROM [nt:base] AS p WHERE p.[cq:lastModified] >= CAST('2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z' AS DATE) AND p.[cq:lastModified] <= CAST('2008-12-31T23:59:59.999Z' AS DATE)
```


This query will find any node which has been modified in 2008. Date conversion for JCR-SQL2 can be somewhat interesting as it expects the date parameter to be in the format 2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z which is not possible to easily produce with a [SimpleDateFormat](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). One method for getting the date in the correct format is:

```
Calendar cal;
ValueFactoryImpl.getInstance().createValue(cal).getString();
```

#### Wrapup

Hopefully, you find these query examples useful, if you see any mistakes or anything I missed, please leave a comment!

**No2 和 No6的区别在于**  
```
SELECT * FROM [nt:base] AS s WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(s, '/content/lincoln/cn/zh_cn') AND CONTAINS(s.title, 'Homepage')

```
返回的是在页面的子节点中title属性包含homepage字符


```
SELECT parent.* FROM [cq:Page] AS parent INNER JOIN [nt:base] AS child ON ISCHILDNODE(child,parent) WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(parent, '/content/lincoln/cn/zh_cn') AND child.[cq:tags] IS NOT NULL 

```
返回的是页面的属性cq:tags不为空的页面
