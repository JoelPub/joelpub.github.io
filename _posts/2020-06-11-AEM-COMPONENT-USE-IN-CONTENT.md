Can
 we detect and remove unused components from our codebase? Is this AEM
component being used at all? How many times is my component used within
my running AEM instance?

These are the common questions we have when we are trying to figure
out the number of use and the node-paths of the targeted searched
component within the Java content repository, known as "JCR". In this
article, you will discover one of the quickest techniques used to
retrieve the total number of uses and node-paths of a component within
the JCR by using the Query Builder API, [query debugger tool](#query-debugger-tool).

If you don't have certain user priveledges within your AEM instance,
there's another way to find out the usage of your component(s), [Components Console](#components-console);
 however, the Components Console is restricted in a sense where the
component search results-list only display pages of a given component
and does not provide a total number of how many pages are returned from
the search.

## 1. Component Search by the Query Builder API, Query Builder Debugger Tool

The AEM Query Builder is an API which can be used to search for nodes
 in JCR. Well defined "Predicates" are typically created from using the
Query Builder Debugging Tool, as this tool serves instant search results
 within the UI.

**Step 1**: With your running AEM instance, visit [http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/search/content/querydebug.html](http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/search/content/querydebug.html).

**Step [2](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2020/06/blog-post-image-query-builder-find-component.jpg)**: Paste in the search query below & hit search; [view screenshot](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2020/06/blog-post-image-query-builder-find-component.jpg).<br>

_Replace with your component's path: weretail/components/content/heroimage_<br>

_Note!: sometimes the descendant path must be more nested, so /content/we-retail/gb/en_

|  |
| :---: |
| 1 2 3 | path =/content /we -retail 1 _property =sling : resourceType 1 _property.value =weretail /components /content /heroimage |

<i>This query searches for all types of nodes with the
sling:resourceType equals to the value,
weretail/components/content/heroimage, and where the path is descendant
from /content/we-retail; to learn more about the Query builder API and
queries,[click here (Adobe Documentation)](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-64/developing/platform/query-builder/querybuilder-api.html)</i>

**Step 3**: Review the results.<br>

**Extra:**

## Find out How many pages are using an AEM template?

The query below will find all cq:Page nodes in the JCR, which
cq:template equals to /conf/we-retail/settings/wcm/templates/hero-page;
under the content path /content/we-retail. The search results will show
you the absolute node page path of whom has the matched property and
value set.

|  |
| :---: |
| 1 2 3 4 | type =cq : Page path =/content /we -retail 1 _property =jcr : content /cq : template 1 _property.value =/conf /we -retail /settings /wcm /templates /hero -page |

Ensuring that the "path" property is set is important, because you
would not want to excessively triverse through the entire JCR; which
will exhaust the AEM environment performance.

**Extra:**

## How to search for all nodes in AEM, JCR, with an existing property?

The query below will search all nodes in the JCR, which
"myCustomProperty" exists; under the content path /content/we-retail.
The search results will show you the absolute node page path of whom has
 the matched property and value set.

|  |
| :---: |
| 1 2 3 | path =/content /we -retail property =myCustomProperty property.operation =exists |

Ensuring that the "path" property is set is important, because you
would not want to excessively triverse through the entire JCR; which
will exhaust the AEM environment performance.

## 2. Component Search by the Components Console

This out of the box Components Console, CC, is available from AEM
6.2+ right under Tools -> General -> Components. The CC displays
search results in a form of pages where the component is being used;
rather than each node from the example above. This console is accessible
 to authors so that even they can check for which pages use the searched
 component.

**Step 1**: Within your running AEM instance, visit [http://localhost:4502/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/components.html](http://localhost:4502/libs/wcm/core/content/sites/components.html).

**Step [2](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2020/06/blog-post-component-console-steps-a.jpg)**:
 Search for a component. Insert your search criteria with either by
"keyword", "component path", or "component group". On every change of
the search criteria, you should see results in a list format on the
right hand side of the search left side bar.<br>

**Step [3](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2020/06/blog-post-component-console-steps-a.jpg)**: Click on the targeted component, and you will be redirected to the details page.<br>

**Step [4](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2020/06/blog-post-component-console-steps-b.jpg)**:
 From the details page, click on "live usage", and a results-list of
pages will be displayed, where the targeted component can be found.<br>

**Step [5](https://sourcedcode.com/storage/2020/06/blog-post-component-console-steps-b.jpg)**: From the results-list, clicking on a link will open the page's editor.
